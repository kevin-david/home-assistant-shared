    Temporarily pause multiple automations and optionally perform an action 
    afterwards (e.g. disable motion lights & turn them off)

    reversal_action:
      name: Action after disabling the automations
      description: >
        Intended to do something like turn on or off devices/lights
        after your automations are temporarily disabled.

        action: {}
    pause_trigger:
      name: Pause Trigger
      description: >
        Select what will trigger the pause. This can be any type of trigger:
          - An input button state change
          - A specific event
          - A device trigger (like a button press)
          - A time pattern
          - etc.
      selector:
        trigger:
    pause_input_switch:
      name: Pause Switch
      description: >
        Input boolean to use to track the pause.
        Create from [helpers](/config/helpers).
      selector:
        entity:
          filter:
            - domain: input_boolean
    countdown_counter:
      name: Countdown Counter
      description: >
        Counter used to track the **minutes** until the automation is re-enabled.
        Create from [helpers](/config/helpers). 
        Tips:
          - **Max** should be the number of minutes you want the automation disabled
          - **Min** should be 0
          - **Step Size** should match the number of minutes in **Countdown check time pattern** below
          - Leave **Restore the last known value when Home Assistant starts** enabled (this makes things robust)

    check_countdown_internal:
      name: Countdown check time pattern (minutes)
      description: >
        **Minutes-based** time pattern for how often to re-run this automation 
        to see if the target automation should be turned off. e.g. `/5`. 
        **MUST MATCH COUNTER STEP SIZE**.
